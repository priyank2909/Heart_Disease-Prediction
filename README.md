## 1) Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction Project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the likelihood of an individual having or developing heart disease. This project leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of heart disease, ultimately contributing to better patient care and management.

## 2) Features
1) Data Integration: Combines data from various sources including medical records, lab tests, and demographic information.
2) Predictive Modeling: Implements multiple machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
3) Model Evaluation: Uses comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
4) Ethical Considerations: Ensures patient data privacy and addresses potential biases in the models.

## 3) Modeling Techniques
1) Logistic Regression: For predicting the probability of a binary outcome.
2) Decision Trees and Random Forests: For classification based on feature values.
3) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For classifying data points based on the 'k' nearest neighbors.

## 4) Evalutation Metrics

1) Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
2) Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
3) Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
4) F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## 5) Installation

1) Clone the Repository:

        git clone https://github.com/priyank2909/heart-disease-prediction.git

2) Install the Requirements:

        pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

## 6) Usage
- Prepare the input data:
        Ensure you have the necessary input files (e.g., heart.csv) in the appropriate directory.
